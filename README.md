# Smart CPQ & Order Tracking System for Manufacturing

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a **Configure-Price-Quote (CPQ) & Order Visibility Hub** for the **Manufacturing Industry** using Salesforce CPQ and Service Cloud.  
It solves the challenge of inaccurate quotes, lack of real-time inventory visibility, and poor customer order tracking.  

The solution automates quoting, validates configurations against inventory, and enables full "Quote-to-Cash" tracking with proactive notifications.
